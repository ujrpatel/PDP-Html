                Leicester. This is my Personal Development Plan and what Steps 
                I have taken to accomplish my goals. I studied Computer Science at 
                GCSE and A-Level and my interest in the subject has been evolving 
                since. In my spare time I like to do leetcode questions and watching 
                Formula 1 highlights.

                I have used an opensource platformcalled FormSubmimt to handle my email 
                forwarding in my contact me page.If the user enters their email then they will 
                recieve a confirmation email.The map page is intended for users to to be able 
                to look at the University of Leicester's Campus. My PDP is simplified for
                viewing pleasure and ease of reading. This project provided a good look into
                HTML, CSS and Java.
